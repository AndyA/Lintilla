            `The face that launched a thousand frocks, according to the
            Daily Telegraph. She spent two years as a catwalk model for
            Lagerfeld, Chanel, Armani and Comme des Garcons. So why isnt
            she on the Style page? Because shes a professional cellist.
            She paid for her first decent cello with modelling money. The
            inevitable headline? `Model cellist swaps catwalk for catgut.
            So has she put her glamour career behind her? Hardly. Philips
            is marketing her debut CD by selling her on her looks. She
            follows in the footsteps of Vanessa Mae (she of the wet T-
            shirt), Ann-Sophie Mutter (she of the legendary cleavage), and
            Linda Brava (who unfurled herself for Playboy). Kotova, 28 and
            5ft 11ins, is the latest pin-up. Brief biog please? Her father
            Ivan Kotov was the Soviet Unions leading double bass player
            until he fell foul of Soviet bureaucracy. He dropped tofifth
            double bass in the state symphony orchestra and was threatened
            with incarceration in a mental institution. Kotova started
            playing the cello at the age of seven. At 15 she won the
            Prague International Competition. After leaving Russia, she
            studied at Cologne Conservatory and Yale. Now she lives in
            Dallas with `a special friend. That probably doesnt mean her
            cello. And her new CD? 14 short romantic pieces performed with
            the Moscow Chamber Orchestra. Theres Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov,
            Elgar and two pieces by the cellist herself, one entitled
            Sketches from the Catwalk. Any good? `Her playing is of the
            highest quality, her tone sensuous and round, her
            interpretation full of passion, vitality and precision,
            claimed the London Evening Standard. But US critic Edith
            Eisler argues: `The playing reflects the rather limited
            expression and mood of the music. And Kotovas verdict? `It
            goes with Anna Karenina, reading, a fireplace, she says. (c)
